<h3><center>Software Developer</center></h3>
<p>I love finding solutions to problems whether it is professional or personal. Learning and coding are a lot like running marathons in that it takes hard work and a good pace, but it's well worth the reward. 
</p>
<p>
I am currently working as the Remote Job Placement Director for The Tech Academy helping students developer their resumes, cover letters and coach them on interview skills as well as reflecting on the value they bring to the workforce and working on areas of opportunity for them to improve themselves.
</p><p>
Currently enrolled at The Tech Academy in their Web Development and Computer Programming Boot Camp. I am learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, C#, PHP as well as computer fundamentals.</p>
<P>Soon I will be turning this page into a porfolio for my coding creations and <a href="https://github.com/mrmichaelgallen/Projects-in-Progress">ideas</a>.</P>
